<h1 id="default_h1">Maya Angelou(1928-2014)</h1>
<p id="default_p">This remarkable lady was an artist, author, lobbyist, and one of the most powerful ladies of her time! Regardless of being a brilliant light on the planet, Maya had a dim youth: she was assaulted by her mom's beau at only 7 years of age, and on account of the injury, she wouldn't talk until she was around 12 years of age. During those dull years, she would communicate through her composition, which drove her to create staggering artistic abilities. Her composing has enlivened a huge number of individuals everywhere in the world, particularly ladies and over-comers of misuse.
